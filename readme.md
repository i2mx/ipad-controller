# iPad Controller

I made this in the holidays in a few hours because I was bored. The code is really bad, but it works, and it's not too hard to go and tamper with the code

What this does is run a website with buttons. When I press the buttons it does stuff on my computer, and i would have this on my ipad. 

I'll just have it here. If you want to use it you can clone this repository.
