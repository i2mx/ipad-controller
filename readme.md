# iPad Controller {#ur gay}

I made this in the holidays in a few hours because I was bored. The code is really bad, but it works, and it's not too hard to go and tamper with the code

What this does is run a website with buttons. When I press the buttons it does stuff on my computer, and i would have this on my ipad. 

I'll just have it here. If you want to use it you can clone this repository.

and then run the following commands in the terminal
```batch
cd backend
node . 

cd ../frontend
yarn start
```

you have to have to do the port forwarding, so that you can go on the website.
